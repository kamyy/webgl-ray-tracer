# WebGL Ray Tracer
I attended a talk given by distinguised Nvidia engineer, Eric Haines at GDC 2019 titled 'A Fast Forward Through [Ray Tracing Gems](http://www.realtimerendering.com/raytracinggems)'. Real-time ray tracing was a hot topic at GDC 2019 and the talk mentioned Peter Shirley's tutorial with regards to writing a [ray tracer in just one weekend](http://www.realtimerendering.com/raytracing/Ray%20Tracing%20in%20a%20Weekend.pdf).

Inspired by what I'd seen at GDC, I've begun the journey of writing my own ray tracer. Whereas Peter Shirley's tutorial uses C++, I've opted to use Javascript and WebGL since the web browser offers major advantages like instant access, updates and best of all portability across different platforms.

My goal is definitely not to complete this work in one weekend but to see how far I can take my understanding of the topic and at the same time create a good implementation. I'm excited to see what I can accomplish!
