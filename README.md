# WebGL Ray Tracer
I attended a talk given by Eric Haines at GDC 2019 titled 'A Fast Forward Through [Ray Tracing Gems](http://www.realtimerendering.com/raytracinggems)'. Real-time ray tracing was a hot topic at GDC 2019 and the talk mentioned Peter Shirley's series of tutorials with regards to writing a [ray tracer in just one weekend](http://www.realtimerendering.com/raytracing/Ray%20Tracing%20in%20a%20Weekend.pdf).

Inspired by what I'd seen at GDC, I've started this project to create my very own renderer that leverages the GPU to ray trace a simple scene. Whereas Peter Shirley's set of tutorials uses C++, I've opted to use Javascript and WebGL since the web browser offers instant access to anybody who wants to take it for a test drive.

My goal isn't to complete this work in one weekend but to see how far I can take my understanding of this topic while still making it work in the browser.
